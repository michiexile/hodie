Welcome to hodie and the fascinating world of latin speakers. This
program exists because of my getting a few wild ideas while browsing
the challenges of dotcomma <http://www.dotcomma.org>.

What does it do?
     It has the same functionality as the date (1) program, only... It
     has it in grammatically correct latin :-)

How do I install it?
     Hodie now has support for autoconf/automake, so you install it
     just as you would any source tarball.

     Most cases will install cleanly with the sequence 

           ./configure
           make
           make install

Dependencies???
     I do assume, that you have a halfways decent UNIX-system,
     preferrably with make, a c-compiler and enough standard libraries
     to support printfs and time-functions... Apart from that, it
     should be totally ANSI-C, and I cannot see why it shouldn't be
     fully portable. It's nothing *really* fancy anyway :-)

Licenses? 
     I release this software under the MIT license. (No, not the GPL
     license. Mainly because I do not quite understand the GPL license
     myself as I do with the MIT and the BSD types.)

     The license conditions are reproduced in the file LICENSE, which
     should be included in every distribution of this software.

     All the spanish stuff is (c) Ivan Juanes. If you can't find any
     spanish stuff, then this does not apply (beginning with my moving
     in at sourceforge, I split spanish and english into two different
     branches. 

Who did this?
     Responsible for this hacklet is
     Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson	  <mikael@johanssons.org>

     Please do e-mail... I'm only happy for feedback :-)
